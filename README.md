#ChatterBox

Module 2, Project #1 - Created by Adam Bernard & Kirsten Swanson

##How the application works

A chatroom style application using localStorage and a prerecorded response. The prerecorded response is appended to the page every time the send button is clicked. The application displays the ten most recent messages. If the "Show all messages" button is clicked it reveals all the messages stored in localStorage. When the send button is clicked it sends the message typed into the input field to localStorage and then renders it to the page. Upon characters typed into the text area the send button is toggled between enabled and disabled. Below the text input field is a character counter that registers the number of characters typed into the text area. The user's message has two buttons appended to them that allow the user to delete or edit their message. All information edited or deleted will also be updated in localStorage.
