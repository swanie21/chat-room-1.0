ChatterBox

A chatroom style application using localStorage and a prerecorded response as a friend that applies its response every time the send button is clicked.  The application shows the previous ten messages, unless the show all messages button is clicked, which shows all messages in localStorage.  The send button is used to send the message into local storage and then renders it to the DOM. The send button is toggled between enabled and disabled as long as the text area has characters typed into it.  There is also a character counter below the text input area that registers the amount of characters typed into the text area.  The user's messages have two buttons appended to them that allow the user to delete their message or edit the text in their message.  All information edited or deleted will also be updated in localStorage.
